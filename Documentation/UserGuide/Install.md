# Installing Cruise Manager

If members of the Forest Service we recommend installing Cruise Manager using the [Software Center](#software-center-installation)

For all other users, the latest version of Cruise Manager downloaded from these links
 - [FMSC Website](https://www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/products/measurement/cruising/cruisemanager/index.php)
 - [Github](https://github.com/FMSC-Measurements/CruiseManager/releases/latest)

## Software Center Installation
If installing Cruise Manager for the first time from the Software Center you may need to uninstall previous versions first. [Follow These Instructions](/Install_Remove_Old_Versions.md) for uninstalling older versions. 

## Installer Modes
The installer for Cruise Manager has two install modes: All Users and Current User only. Both install options will create a Desktop Icon for you and associate .cruise files with cruise manager. But, if you are installing on a computer where you do not have administrator permissions you should still be able to install using the Current User install mode.
