:::Optional COConverter Notes:::
The optional COConverter add on allows users to open legacy CRZ files by converting them to the new .Cruise format.
To use this addon, first make sure that Cruise System Manager is installed, then run the installer for COConverter.
If Cruise System Manager was not installed in the default directory, be sure to install COConverter in the same directory. 

COConverter requires Python 2.7 to run, therefore, you will need to have administrator privileges to install COConverter.
